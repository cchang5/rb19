    The topics covered in this workshop broadly cover common research interests at RIKEN, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, and UC Berkeley. We aim to invite researchers from different institutes to each session and supply everyone involved with an ample amount of coffee and cookies.<br><br>
    A *tentative* list of topics include<br>
    * Qubit technology
    	* Advances in silicon-based qubits.
    	* High-level user facing programming layer.
    * Quantum enhanced optimization
    	* How to formulate problems within the framework of a adiabatic quantum computer. 
    	* Advances in quantum adiabatic computation.
    * Quantum chemistry
    	* High-level user facing programming layer.
    	* Discussion of variational quantum eigensolver.
    * Condensed matter systems
    	* Exitons, nanowires, charge density waves, and their applications to quantum computing / storage devices.
    * Quantum sensing for nuclear physics
    	* Dark matter detection, precision detectors, single microwave detectors, etc...
    * Quantum communication
    * DMRG / tensor networks
