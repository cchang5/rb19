<font color="#FFFFFF">
The RIKEN Interdisciplinary Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences Program (iTHEMS) is an international research program based out of RIKEN. Researchers across various disciplines of theoretical, mathematical, and computational sciences gather together with purpose of finding commonality between what may appear as largely unrelated fields. However, through discussion between researchers of different backgrounds, we may discover mature methodologies in other fields that are suitable for our main research goals. The RIKEN iTHEMS program aims to give researchers the environment and resources to explore such connections in the hope of leading to breakthroughs that are otherwise enigmatic.<br><br>
Lawrence Berkeley National Lab is an international partner institution aimed to further the iTHEMS mission by allowing researchers to circulate between the Bay Area and the Greater Tokyo Area. Home to the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), which houses one of the supercomputers in the United States, Berkeley Lab provides an ideal hub for researchers who are heavily vested in computational sciences. The unique partnership between Berkeley Lab and the University of California, Berkeley provides additional access to cutting-edge technology and opportunities for collaboration. The close proximity to San Francisco and the Bay Area also presents unique opportunities for a more diverse set of partnerships.<br><br>
